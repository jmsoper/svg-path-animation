This is a demo of how to animate SVG paths using JavaScript.

A much better way to do so is just to use the Greensock plugin, `morphSVG` but since that can only be used without a license inside of CodePen, I thought I'd see how hard it was to make my own (much simpler, less powerful) version.

It ended up really being an exploration in all the ways I can commit reference errors, but it helped me to think about how animations get built together, and how to think of motion in a step-by-step sense. In reality, there isn't really a good reason (that I can think of) why this shouldn't be in canvas, and there are a host of reasons why it should. 

Applications moving forward (or ideas for you to tinker with and try for yourself!):

1. What if, instead of generating random waves to have continous motion, the lines were at rest until the cursor interacted with them? For example, a cursor moving over the box could displace lines, dragging the curves after it, or click could open up a space between the lines.

2. This seems like exactly the sort of thing that could actually make some feel nauseous/overwhelmed looking at a website. What would be an easy way to make it pause-able? 

3. What's a way to make this code easier to read and more reusable? 


4. ...Now how would we do this the right way with GreenSock?
